# UNRL Methods
This repository will contain the following methods for network embedding:
1. DeepWalk
2. Node2Vec
3. Line-1
4. NetMF
5. GraphSage

Each method is contained in its own package with its own requirements.txt. This is to facilitate the debugging of individual methods. There is (will be) a package with all the datasets that are used

# TODOs
Embedding methods:
1. DeepWalk - 100%
2. Node2Vec - 100%
3. Line-1 - 100% but missing testing
4. NetMF - ??
5. GraphSage - ??

Search of original datasets 90%
Missing: DBLP-Au, CoCit

Search of new datasets
1. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wikipedia-article-networks.html
2. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html

Implementation of tasks:
1. Link prediction - 0%
2. Node classification - 70%
