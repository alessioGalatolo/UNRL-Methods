# UNRL Methods
This repository will contain the following methods for network embedding:
1. DeepWalk
2. Node2Vec
3. Line-1
4. NetMF
5. GraphSage

Each method is contained in its own package with its own requirements.txt. This is to facilitate the debugging of individual methods. There is (will be) a package with all the datasets that are used

# TODOs
Embedding methods:
1. DeepWalk - ??
2. Node2Vec  -??
3. Line-1 - 70% but missing testing
4. NetMF - ??
5. GraphSage - ??
